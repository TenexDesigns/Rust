**Constants in Rust: Overview and Usage**

### Constants:
Constants in Rust are values bound to a name that remain immutable throughout the program's execution. Unlike variables, constants have some distinctive features:

1. **Immutability:**
   - Constants are immutable by default and can't be changed during runtime.
   - The `const` keyword is used to declare constants.

     ```rust
     const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
     ```

2. **Declaration and Naming Conventions:**
   - Constants must be annotated with their type.
   - Naming convention: All-uppercase with underscores between words (e.g., `THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS`).

3. **Scope:**
   - Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope.
   - Useful for values that multiple parts of the code need to know about.

4. **Initialization:**
   - Constants must be initialized with a constant expression, computed at compile time.
   - Example: Multiplying constants to calculate seconds in three hours.

5. **Use Cases:**
   - Ideal for hardcoded values used across the program, such as configuration parameters or mathematical constants.
   - Enhances code readability and maintainability by providing a single point for value changes.



Sure, here is a summary of the article about constants in Rust:

**What are constants?**

Constants are values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change. They are declared using the `const` keyword.

**What is constant evaluation?**

Constant evaluation is the process of computing the result of expressions during compilation. Only a subset of all expressions can be evaluated at compile-time.

**What are constant expressions?**

Constant expressions are expressions that can be evaluated at compile-time. They are the only expressions that are allowed in constant contexts.

**What is a const context?**

A const context is a place where only constant expressions are allowed. This includes the initializer of constants, statics, enum discriminants, and const generic arguments.

**What are const functions?**

Const functions are functions that can be called from a const context. They are declared using the `const fn` keyword.

**What are the restrictions of const functions?**

Const functions are restricted in order to make sure that they can be evaluated at compile-time. This means that they cannot do anything that could cause side effects, such as calling functions that could panic or reading from mutable variables.

**What are the benefits of using constants?**

Constants can make your code more readable and maintainable. They can also make your code more efficient by avoiding unnecessary runtime computations.

**What are the requirements for using constants?**

The value of a constant must be a constant expression. This means that it must be able to be computed at compile-time.

**Where are constants used?**

Constants can be used anywhere that a variable is used. However, they are most commonly used in cases where the value of the variable is not expected to change.

I hope this summary is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.







### Constant Evaluation:

#### Constant Expressions:
Constant expressions are a subset of expressions that can be evaluated at compile time. These include:

- Literals.
- Const parameters.
- Paths to functions and constants.
- Tuple, array, and struct expressions.
- Block expressions.
- Loop, while, and if expressions.
- Calls of const functions and methods.
- ...

#### Const Context:
A const context is a specific environment where constant expressions must be used. It includes:

- Array type length expressions.
- Array repeat length expressions.
- Initializer of constants, statics, and enum discriminants.
- Const generic arguments.

### Const Functions:

#### Definition:
A `const fn` (const function) is a function permitted to be called from a const context. It has no effect on existing uses but imposes restrictions on argument and return types.

#### Characteristics:
- Can be freely used like regular functions.
- Interpreted at compile time in the compilation target's environment.
- Calling a const function at compile time yields the same result as at runtime.
- Restrictions to ensure compile-time evaluation (e.g., no random number generation).
- Floating-point operations are limited; results are consistent but may vary slightly in extreme situations.

#### Usage:
- Use the `const fn` keyword to define const functions.
- Ideal for computations that need to be performed at compile time.

### Conclusion:

Constants in Rust provide a mechanism for defining unchangeable values, promoting code safety and maintainability. Constant evaluation and const functions further extend the capabilities of compile-time computation, allowing for efficient and reliable code. Understanding the distinctions between constants, constant expressions, and const functions is crucial for leveraging these features effectively in Rust programming.

In Rust, constants are fixed values that never change. They are declared using the `const` keyword and their type must be annotated. Unlike variables, constants are always immutable and can't be changed once they're declared. Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes them useful for values that many parts of the code need to know about [Source 3](https://www.w3schools.io/languages/rust-constants/), [Source 6](https://iq.opengenus.org/constant-in-rust/), [Source 10](https://www.techieindoor.com/rust-constant-in-rust/).

Here's an example of a constant declaration:

```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

In this example, `THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS` is a constant whose value is set to the result of multiplying 60 (the number of seconds in a minute) by 60 (the number of minutes in an hour) by 3 (the number of hours we want to count in this program) [Source 3](https://www.w3schools.io/languages/rust-constants/).

Rust also supports constant expressions, which are expressions that can be evaluated at compile time. These are the only allowed expressions in `const` contexts and are always evaluated at compile time. The following expressions are constant expressions:

- Literals
- Const parameters
- Paths to functions and constants
- Tuple expressions
- Array expressions
- Struct expressions
- Block expressions, including unsafe blocks
- let statements and thus irrefutable patterns, including mutable bindings
- Assignment expressions
- Compound assignment expressions
- Expression statements
- Field expressions
- Index expressions, array indexing or slice with a usize
- Range expressions
- Closure expressions which don't capture variables from the environment
- Built-in negation, arithmetic, logical, comparison or lazy boolean operators used on integer and floating point types, bool, and char
- Shared borrows, except if applied to a type with interior mutability
- The dereference operator except for raw pointers
- Grouped expressions
- Cast expressions, except pointer to address casts and function pointer to address casts
- Calls of const functions and const methods
- loop, while and while let expressions
- if, if let and match expressions [Source 15](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70049189/const-expressions-inside-trait).

Rust also supports const functions, which are functions that can be called from a `const` context. When called from a `const` context, the function is interpreted by the compiler at compile time. The interpretation happens in the environment of the compilation target and not the host. So `usize` is 32 bits if you are compiling against a 32 bit system, irrelevant of whether you are building on a 64 bit or a 32 bit system [Source 20](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/basic-syntax/static-and-const.html).

Here's an example of a const function:

```rust
const fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
   a + b
}
```

In this example, `add` is a const function that takes two `i32` parameters and returns their sum. The function can be called in a `const` context like this:

```rust
const SUM: i32 = add(5, 6);
```

In this example, `SUM` is a constant that is set to the result of the `add` function when called with the arguments 5 and 6. The value of `SUM` is determined at compile time and can't be changed [Source 20](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/basic-syntax/static-and-const.html).
