In Rust, as in any programming language, solving problems requires a combination of understanding the problem, understanding the syntax and semantics of the language, and knowing how to apply algorithms and data structures.

**Understanding the problem**

The first step to solving any problem is to understand what the problem is asking for. This involves carefully reading and analyzing the problem statement to identify the inputs, outputs, and any constraints or assumptions. Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, you can start to think about how to approach it.

**Understanding the syntax and semantics of Rust**

Rust has a specific syntax and semantics that you need to understand in order to write correct code. This includes understanding the basic data types, control flow statements, and functions. You also need to understand the ownership rules of Rust, which are essential for managing memory safely.

**Knowing how to apply algorithms and data structures**

Algorithms and data structures are the building blocks of problem-solving. You need to know how to choose the right algorithm for the problem at hand and how to implement it in Rust. You also need to know how to use the appropriate data structures to store and manipulate data efficiently.

**Can we understand the logic based on code flow?**

In some cases, you may be able to understand the logic of a Rust program based on the code flow. However, in more complex cases, you will need to have a deeper understanding of the syntax and semantics of the language.

**Where is the check for if the word was present or not?**

The location of the check for whether a word was present or not depends on the specific algorithm being used. However, in general, the check will be done inside a loop that iterates over the input data.

**Is this how Rust code is, things just happen based on things specific to Rust and not programmatically solved?**

No, Rust code is not just a collection of things that happen based on things specific to Rust. Rust code is written using algorithms and data structures, just like code in other programming languages. The difference is that Rust has its own syntax and semantics, which you need to understand in order to write correct code.

**Here are some examples of how Rust code solves problems programmatically:**

* **Sorting:** Rust has several built-in sorting algorithms, such as quicksort and mergesort. These algorithms are implemented in Rust code, and they can be used to sort any type of data that can be compared.
* **Searching:** Rust has several built-in searching algorithms, such as binary search. These algorithms are implemented in Rust code, and they can be used to search for elements in any type of data structure that can be indexed.
* **Parsing:** Rust has several libraries for parsing text, such as serde. These libraries are implemented in Rust code, and they can be used to parse text into structured data.

In all of these cases, Rust code is used to solve problems programmatically. The code is written using algorithms and data structures, and it follows the syntax and semantics of the Rust language.
