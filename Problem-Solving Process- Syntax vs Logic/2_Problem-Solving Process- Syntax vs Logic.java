Solving problems in Rust, like in any other programming language, involves understanding the problem, designing a solution, and then implementing that solution in code. However, Rust's unique features, such as its strong type system, memory safety guarantees, and ownership model, can sometimes make the code flow more complex than in other languages.

When solving a problem in Rust, you need to understand both the problem itself and the Rust syntax and semantics. This means you need to understand the problem's requirements and constraints, and you also need to understand how to use Rust's features to implement a solution.

For example, if you're implementing a recursive function in Rust, you need to understand how recursion works in general, and you also need to understand how Rust handles recursion. Rust has strict rules about recursion to prevent stack overflow errors, so you need to be aware of these rules when writing recursive functions.

Similarly, if you're implementing a data structure like a hash map in Rust, you need to understand how hash maps work in general, and you also need to understand how Rust's `HashMap` type works. Rust's `HashMap` type has specific methods for inserting, retrieving, and removing elements, and it also has specific rules about ownership and borrowing.

Here's an example of how you might use a `HashMap` to check if a word is present or not:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert(String::from("hello"), 1);

let word = String::from("hello");
if map.contains_key(&word) {
   println!("The word is present.");
} else {
   println!("The word is not present.");
}
```

In this example, the `contains_key` method is used to check if the word is present in the `HashMap`. This is a specific feature of Rust's `HashMap` type, and it's not something that would be present in a hash map in another language.

In general, understanding Rust's syntax and semantics is crucial for solving problems in Rust, because it allows you to use Rust's features effectively and safely. However, the logic of the solution is determined by the problem itself, not by the Rust language. The Rust language is a tool that you use to implement your solution, and the way you use it depends on the problem you're trying to solve [Source 0](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/project-euler-problems-in-rust/), [Source 8](https://serokell.io/blog/rust-guide), [Source 13](https://reintech.io/blog/introduction-to-rust-syntax-and-semantics), [Source 14](https://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/book/first-edition/syntax-and-semantics.html), [Source 19](https://reintech.io/blog/guide-rust-documentation-community-resources), [Source 24](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/blob/main/first-edition/src/syntax-and-semantics.md), [Source 26](https://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/book/first-edition/ownership.html).

  Sure, let's go through each of these topics one by one.

1. **Fibonacci**: The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. Here's how you can implement a Fibonacci sequence in Rust using recursion:

```rust
fn fibonacci(n: u64) -> u64 {
   match n {
       0 => 0,
       1 => 1,
       _ => fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2),
   }
}
```
In this function, we use pattern matching to handle the base cases (0 and 1) and the recursive case (where we call the function with `n - 1` and `n - 2`) [Source 2](https://rust.helpful.codes/tutorials/How-to-calculate-Fibonacci/), [Source 24](https://blog.devgenius.io/async-recursive-functions-in-rust-dce0a1134fed).

2. **Recursion**: Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself. Here's an example of a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number:

```rust
fn factorial(n: u64) -> u64 {
   match n {
       0 => 1,
       _ => n * factorial(n - 1),
   }
}
```
In this function, we use pattern matching to handle the base case (0, where the factorial is 1) and the recursive case (where we multiply `n` by the factorial of `n - 1`) [Source 13](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65948553/why-is-recursion-not-suggested-in-rust).

3. **Merge Sort**: Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides a list into two halves, sorts them, and then merges them. Here's how you can implement merge sort in Rust:

```rust
fn merge_sort(mut vec: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
   if vec.len() <= 1 {
       return vec;
   }

   let mid = vec.len() / 2;
   let mut left = vec[..mid].to_vec();
   let mut right = vec[mid..].to_vec();

   left = merge_sort(left);
   right = merge_sort(right);

   merge(left, right)
}

fn merge(mut left: Vec<i32>, mut right: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
   let mut result = Vec::new();
   let mut left_index = 0;
   let mut right_index = 0;

   while left_index < left.len() && right_index < right.len() {
       if left[left_index] < right[right_index] {
           result.push(left[left_index]);
           left_index += 1;
       } else {
           result.push(right[right_index]);
           right_index += 1;
       }
   }

   result.append(&mut left[left_index..].to_vec());
   result.append(&mut right[right_index..].to_vec());

   result
}
```
In this code, we first split the vector into two halves and sort them recursively. Then, we merge the sorted halves together.

4. **Linked List**: A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (node) of a list consists of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. Here's how you can implement a simple singly linked list in Rust:

```rust
pub struct ListNode<T> {
   value: T,
   next: Option<Box<ListNode<T>>>,
}

impl<T> ListNode<T> {
   pub fn new(value: T) -> ListNode<T> {
       ListNode { value, next: None }
   }
}
```
In this code, we define a `ListNode` struct that contains a value of any type `T` and a `next` field that points to the next node in the list. The `next` field is an `Option` that contains a `Box` to the next node, allowing us to have a singly linked list where each node has a reference to the next node but not the previous one.

Remember, the logic of these solutions is determined by the problem you're trying to solve, not by the Rust language. The Rust language is a tool that you use to implement your solution, and the way you use it depends on the problem you're trying to solve.
