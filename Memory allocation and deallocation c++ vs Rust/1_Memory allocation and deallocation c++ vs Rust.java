In C++, memory allocation and deallocation are tasks that developers need to manage manually. C++ provides operators like `new` and `delete` for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. Developers are responsible for allocating memory when needed and deallocating it when it's no longer in use to avoid memory leaks.

Here's a simple example in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Dynamic memory allocation
    int *arr = new int[5];

    // Use the allocated memory
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        arr[i] = i * 2;
    }

    // Deallocate memory
    delete[] arr;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, an array of integers is dynamically allocated using `new`, and it's deallocated using `delete[]` when it's no longer needed.

Rust, on the other hand, uses a different approach. Rust employs a system of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes to manage memory safety without the need for manual allocation and deallocation. In Rust, the borrow checker ensures that references to memory are valid, preventing common issues like use-after-free and dangling pointers.

Here's an example in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Dynamic memory allocation (using a Vec, a growable array)
    let mut vec = Vec::new();

    // Use the allocated memory
    for i in 0..5 {
        vec.push(i * 2);
    }

    // Memory is automatically deallocated when 'vec' goes out of scope
}
```

In Rust, the `Vec` type is used to create a dynamic array. The memory management, including allocation and deallocation, is handled by the ownership system, making it safer and preventing common memory-related issues.

In summary, while C++ requires manual memory management using `new` and `delete`, Rust's ownership system eliminates the need for manual memory allocation and deallocation, providing memory safety at compile time. Rust's borrow checker ensures that references to memory are valid, preventing many common memory-related errors.
