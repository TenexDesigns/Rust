In Rust, data types can be broadly categorized into two main groups: scalar types and compound types.

### Scalar Types:

1. **Integers:**
   - Signed integers: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`
   - Unsigned integers: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`
   ```rust
   let a: i32 = 42;
   let b: u64 = 123;
   ```

2. **Floating-Point:**
   - `f32` and `f64`
   ```rust
   let c: f32 = 3.14;
   let d: f64 = 2.71828;
   ```

3. **Booleans:**
   - `bool`
   ```rust
   let is_true: bool = true;
   let is_false: bool = false;
   ```

4. **Characters:**
   - `char`
   ```rust
   let e: char = 'A';
   ```

### Compound Types:

1. **Tuples:**
   - Fixed-size ordered list of elements.
   ```rust
   let tuple: (i32, f64, char) = (42, 3.14, 'A');
   let (x, y, z) = tuple; // Destructuring
   ```

2. **Arrays:**
   - Fixed-size array of elements of the same type.
   ```rust
   let array: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let first_element = array[0];
   ```

3. **Slices:**
   - A dynamically sized view into a contiguous sequence, represented by a reference to a portion of an array.
   ```rust
   let slice: &[i32] = &array[1..4];
   ```

4. **Strings:**
   - A sequence of characters.
   ```rust
   let string: String = String::from("Hello, Rust!");
   let string_slice: &str = "Hello, Rust!";
   ```

5. **Enums:**
   - A type that can have multiple values.
   ```rust
   enum Coin {
       Penny,
       Nickel,
       Dime,
       Quarter,
   }
   let coin: Coin = Coin::Quarter;
   ```

6. **Structs:**
   - Define a custom data type.
   ```rust
   struct Person {
       name: String,
       age: u32,
   }
   let person = Person {
       name: String::from("Alice"),
       age: 30,
   };
   ```

7. **Option:**
   - Represents either a value (`Some`) or nothing (`None`).
   ```rust
   let maybe_number: Option<i32> = Some(42);
   ```

8. **Result:**
   - Represents either a successful value (`Ok`) or an error (`Err`).
   ```rust
   fn divide(x: f64, y: f64) -> Result<f64, &'static str> {
       if y != 0.0 {
           Ok(x / y)
       } else {
           Err("Division by zero")
       }
   }
   ```

These are some of the fundamental data types in Rust. Rust is known for its strong type system, which helps prevent many common programming errors.

Sure, I can provide you with a comprehensive overview of data types in Rust, along with code samples, explanations, and usage scenarios.

Data types in Rust are fundamental building blocks for organizing and manipulating data within your code. Each data type represents a distinct category of information and defines the range of permissible values and operations that can be performed on that data.

### Scalar Data Types

Scalar data types represent single, indivisible values. They are the most basic data types in Rust and include:

- **Integers:** Integers represent whole numbers, such as 1, 100, or -20. They are further categorized into signed (i8, i16, i32, i64, i128) and unsigned (u8, u16, u32, u64, u128) types.

```rust
let age: i32 = 25; // Signed integer
let count: u8 = 10; // Unsigned integer
```

- **Floating-Point Numbers:** Floating-point numbers represent real numbers, including decimals and fractions, such as 3.14, 100.5, or -2.718. They are classified into f32 (single-precision) and f64 (double-precision) types.

```rust
let pi: f64 = 3.14159265358979323846; // Double-precision floating-point number
let temperature: f32 = 22.5; // Single-precision floating-point number
```

- **Booleans:** Booleans represent logical values, either true or false. They are often used in conditional statements and control flow.

```rust
let is_active: bool = true; // Boolean value
let is_completed: bool = false; // Boolean value
```

- **Characters:** Characters represent single letters, digits, or special symbols. They are typically enclosed in single quotes.

```rust
let initial: char = 'A'; // Character value
let symbol: char = '&'; // Character value
```

### Compound Data Types

Compound data types represent structured collections of data, allowing you to group related values together. They include:

- **Tuples:** Tuples are ordered collections of values with a fixed length. Each value in a tuple can be of a different data type.

```rust
let coordinates: (i32, i32) = (5, 3); // Tuple of two integers
let person: (String, u32) = ("Alice".to_string(), 30); // Tuple of a string and an integer
```

- **Arrays:** Arrays are fixed-size collections of elements of the same data type. They are indexed using integers, starting from 0.

```rust
let numbers: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // Array of five integers
let names: [&str; 3] = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]; // Array of three string slices
```

- **Slices:** Slices are dynamically sized views into a contiguous portion of an array. They are similar to arrays, but their length can change at runtime.

```rust
let data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let slice: &[i32] = &data[2..4]; // Slice of two integers from the original array
```

- **Structs:** Structs are custom data types that define a collection of named fields. Each field can be of a different data type.

```rust
struct User {
    name: String,
    email: String,
    age: u32,
}

let user = User {
    name: "Bob".to_string(),
    email: "bob@example.com".to_string(),
    age: 35,
};
```

- **Enums:** Enums are user-defined types that represent a set of possible values. Each variant of an enum can have associated data.

```rust
enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
}

let color = Color::Green;
```

### Usage of Data Types

Data types play a crucial role in Rust programming, enabling you to organize, manipulate, and store data effectively. They are essential for building structured programs and ensuring type safety, which helps prevent errors and maintain code integrity.

Here are some common usage scenarios for data types:

- **Storing and retrieving data:** Data types provide a standardized way to store and retrieve information from variables, arrays, structs, and other data structures.

- **Performing calculations and operations:** Data types allow you to perform various
