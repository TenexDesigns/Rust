In Rust, data types are often associated with traits, and traits can have methods defined for them. Traits are similar to interfaces in other languages. Rust uses a system of traits to define behavior for types.

For example, the `ToString` trait defines a `to_string` method, which can be called on types that implement this trait to convert them to a `String`. Similarly, the `Display` trait defines a `fmt` method for custom formatting.

Here's a simple example:

```rust
// Define a struct
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

// Implement the ToString trait for the Point struct
impl ToString for Point {
    fn to_string(&self) -> String {
        format!("({}, {})", self.x, self.y)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let my_point = Point { x: 3, y: 5 };

    // Call the to_string method on the Point instance
    let point_str = my_point.to_string();

    println!("Point as a string: {}", point_str);
}
```

In this example, the `Point` struct implements the `ToString` trait by providing a `to_string` method. This allows instances of the `Point` struct to be converted to strings using the `to_string` method.

Rust also has a feature called "associated functions" that are similar to static methods in other languages. These functions are associated with the type itself rather than an instance of the type.

Keep in mind that Rust's approach to methods and traits is different from some other languages, and it emphasizes static dispatch and explicitness. If you're coming from a different programming background, it might take some time to get used to Rust's ownership system and trait system.

Yes, in Rust, structs, enums, and traits can have methods. Primitive data types like integers, floats, booleans, and characters do not have methods.

Here is a table summarizing which data types in Rust have methods:

| Data Type | Has Methods |
|---|---|
| Primitive data types (i8, i16, i32, i64, u8, u16, u32, u64, f32, f64, bool, char) | No |
| Tuples | No |
| Lists | No |
| Dictionaries | No |
| Structs | Yes |
| Enums | Yes |
| Traits | Yes |

As you can see, structs, enums, and traits are the data types in Rust that can have methods. Methods are functions that are attached to structs, enums, and traits. They allow you to add functionality to these data types.

For example, here is a struct called `Point` that represents a point in 2D space:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
```

The `Point` struct has two methods: `distance_from` and `translate`. The `distance_from` method takes another point as its argument and returns the distance between the two points. The `translate` method takes two i32 values as its arguments and translates the point by those values.

```rust
impl Point {
    fn distance_from(&self, other: &Point) -> f64 {
        ((self.x - other.x).pow(2) + (self.y - other.y).pow(2)).sqrt()
    }

    fn translate(&mut self, x: i32, y: i32) {
        self.x += x;
        self.y += y;
    }
}
```

Methods are a powerful tool for adding functionality to your Rust code. They allow you to encapsulate behavior within data types, making your code more modular and reusable.
