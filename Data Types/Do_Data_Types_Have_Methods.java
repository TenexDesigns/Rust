Yes, in Rust, structs, enums, and traits can have methods. Primitive data types like integers, floats, booleans, and characters do not have methods.

Here is a table summarizing which data types in Rust have methods:

| Data Type | Has Methods |
|---|---|
| Primitive data types (i8, i16, i32, i64, u8, u16, u32, u64, f32, f64, bool, char) | No |
| Tuples | No |
| Lists | No |
| Dictionaries | No |
| Structs | Yes |
| Enums | Yes |
| Traits | Yes |

As you can see, structs, enums, and traits are the data types in Rust that can have methods. Methods are functions that are attached to structs, enums, and traits. They allow you to add functionality to these data types.

For example, here is a struct called `Point` that represents a point in 2D space:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
```

The `Point` struct has two methods: `distance_from` and `translate`. The `distance_from` method takes another point as its argument and returns the distance between the two points. The `translate` method takes two i32 values as its arguments and translates the point by those values.

```rust
impl Point {
    fn distance_from(&self, other: &Point) -> f64 {
        ((self.x - other.x).pow(2) + (self.y - other.y).pow(2)).sqrt()
    }

    fn translate(&mut self, x: i32, y: i32) {
        self.x += x;
        self.y += y;
    }
}
```

Methods are a powerful tool for adding functionality to your Rust code. They allow you to encapsulate behavior within data types, making your code more modular and reusable.
