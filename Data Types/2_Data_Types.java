In Rust, every value is of a certain data type, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data. Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it. However, in cases when many types are possible, we must add a type annotation [Source 1](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-02-data-types.html).

Rust has two primary data type subsets: scalar and compound.

**Scalar Types**

A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters [Source 1](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-02-data-types.html).

- **Integers**: Rust provides signed and unsigned integer types of different sizes. For example, `i32` represents a 32-bit signed integer, and `u32` represents a 32-bit unsigned integer [Source 6](https://www.blog.jasmeenmaradeeya.dev/introduction-to-variable-declaration-and-data-types-in-rust).

```rust
let my_int: i32 = 10;
let my_unsigned_int: u32 = 10;
```

- **Floating-Point Types**: Rust has two floating-point types: `f32` and `f64`. `f32` is a 32-bit floating point type, and `f64` is a 64-bit floating point type [Source 0](https://www.programiz.com/rust/data-types).

```rust
let my_float: f32 = 10.0;
let my_double: f64 = 10.0;
```

- **Booleans**: The Boolean type has two possible values: `true` and `false`. It's used for logical operations and control flow [Source 6](https://www.blog.jasmeenmaradeeya.dev/introduction-to-variable-declaration-and-data-types-in-rust).

```rust
let my_bool: bool = true;
```

- **Characters**: The `char` type represents a single Unicode character and is denoted by single quotes, e.g., `'A'` [Source 6](https://www.blog.jasmeenmaradeeya.dev/introduction-to-variable-declaration-and-data-types-in-rust).

```rust
let my_char: char = 'A';
```

**Compound Types**

Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two compound types: tuples and arrays.

- **Tuples**: A tuple is a collection of values of different types. For example, `(i32, f64, u8)` is a tuple that contains an `i32`, an `f64`, and a `u8` [Source 1](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-02-data-types.html).

```rust
let my_tuple: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
```

- **Arrays**: An array is a collection of values of the same type. For example, `[1, 2, 3]` is an array that contains three `i32` integers [Source 1](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-02-data-types.html).

```rust
let my_array: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];
```

In addition to these, Rust also has more complex data types like `struct` and `enum` which are used to create more complex data structures.

Rust also supports type inference, which means you can create variables without mentioning a data type, and Rust will automatically identify the data type by looking at the value of the variable [Source 0](https://www.programiz.com/rust/data-types).

```rust
let x = 51; // Rust automatically sets i32 as the type
```

In summary, data types in Rust are used to specify the kind of data a variable can hold. They help the compiler understand how to work with the data, and they can be explicitly specified or inferred by the compiler.
