No, Rust macros are not the only way to display structs and other data types. There are a few other ways to do this, including:

* **Using the `{:?}` format specifier:** This format specifier will print a debug representation of the data type. For example, the following code will print a debug representation of the `MyStruct` struct:

```rust
struct MyStruct {
    field1: i32,
    field2: String,
}

fn main() {
    let my_struct = MyStruct {
        field1: 42,
        field2: String::from("Hello, world!"),
    };

    println!("{:?}", my_struct);
}
```

This will print the following output:

```
MyStruct { field1: 42, field2: "Hello, world!" }
```

* **Using the `Display` trait:** The `Display` trait can be implemented for any type to provide a custom printing format. For example, the following code implements the `Display` trait for the `MyStruct` struct:

```rust
struct MyStruct {
    field1: i32,
    field2: String,
}

impl std::fmt::Display for MyStruct {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut std::fmt::Formatter) -> std::fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "MyStruct {{ field1: {}, field2: {} }}", self.field1, self.field2)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let my_struct = MyStruct {
        field1: 42,
        field2: String::from("Hello, world!"),
    };

    println!("{}", my_struct);
}
```

This will print the following output:

```
MyStruct { field1: 42, field2: Hello, world! }
```

* **Using a custom formatting function:** You can also write your own custom formatting function to print data types. For example, the following code defines a custom formatting function for the `MyStruct` struct:

```rust
struct MyStruct {
    field1: i32,
    field2: String,
}

fn format_my_struct(my_struct: &MyStruct) -> String {
    format!("MyStruct {{ field1: {}, field2: {} }}", my_struct.field1, my_struct.field2)
}

fn main() {
    let my_struct = MyStruct {
        field1: 42,
        field2: String::from("Hello, world!"),
    };

    println!("{}", format_my_struct(&my_struct));
}
```

This will print the following output:

```
MyStruct { field1: 42, field2: Hello, world! }
```

These are just a few of the ways to display structs and other data types in Rust. The best way to do this will depend on the specific needs of your application.

Here is a table summarizing the pros and cons of each method:

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| `{:?}` format specifier | Easy to use | Does not provide a lot of control over the formatting |
| `Display` trait | Provides more control over the formatting | Requires more code to implement |
| Custom formatting function | Provides the most control over the formatting | Requires the most code to write |

I hope this helps!
