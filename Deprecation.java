The deprecation of certain modules in Rust is primarily due to the introduction of associated constants for primitive types, which simplifies the way developers access constants related to these types.

For example, in the past, to access the minimum value for an `i32` type, you would use `std::i32::MIN`. However, this module is being deprecated in favor of using `i32::MIN` directly. This change simplifies the API and reduces the number of modules that developers need to remember.

The deprecation notice for these modules states: "Deprecating in a future Rust version: all constants in this module replaced by associated constants on i8" [Source 0](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70946249/why-will-rust-integer-types-be-deprecated-soon).

This change is part of the Rust language's ongoing efforts to simplify its API and make it more consistent and user-friendly. The Rust team regularly reviews and updates its modules based on feedback from the community and changes in the language's direction. 

When a module is deprecated, it means that it's planned to be removed in a future version of Rust. This gives developers time to update their code to use the new APIs before the old ones are removed.

In terms of what these modules are being replaced by, it's the associated constants on the primitive types themselves. For example, `std::i32::MIN` is being replaced with `i32::MIN`. This change simplifies the API and makes it easier for developers to access these constants.

Remember, it's important to keep up with the latest changes in Rust to ensure your code remains compatible and efficient. The Rust documentation and the Rust GitHub repository are good resources for staying updated.

The listed items are being deprecated in Rust because they are considered redundant or inefficient. They are being replaced with more direct and efficient ways of accessing the same functionality.

Here is a breakdown of why each item is being deprecated and what it is being replaced with:

* **Redundant constants modules:** The constants modules for the integer primitive types (i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, isize, and usize) are being deprecated because they are considered redundant. The constants can be accessed directly from the associated primitive types themselves, such as i8::MAX instead of i8::MAX_VALUE.

* **io:** The io trait and its related types are being deprecated in favor of the newer io::Result type and its associated methods. The newer approach provides a more consistent and ergonomic way to handle I/O errors.

* **iter:** The iter trait and its related types are being deprecated in favor of the newer Iterator trait and its associated methods. The newer approach provides a more consistent and extensible interface for iterators.

* **marker:** The marker trait and its associated types are being deprecated because they are considered too low-level and not well-suited for general use. They are being replaced with more specific and higher-level traits where appropriate.

* **vec:** The vec trait and its associated types are being deprecated because they are considered too low-level and not well-suited for general use. They are being replaced with the newer slice trait and its associated methods.

In summary, these deprecations are being made to improve the overall consistency, efficiency, and ergonomics of the Rust language. The newer approaches provide a more consistent and easier-to-use interface for accessing constants, handling I/O errors, iterating over collections, and working with markers and slices.
