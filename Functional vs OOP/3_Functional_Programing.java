Functional programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are two major paradigms in software development, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. They can be used in various languages such as Node.js, TypeScript, and Rust.

**Functional Programming**

Functional programming is a paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions.

Key features of functional programming include:
- First-class and higher-order functions: Functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, stored in data structures, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from other functions [Source 1](https://www.educative.io/blog/functional-programming-vs-oop).
- Immutability: In functional programming, data is immutable. This means that once a data structure is created, it cannot be changed. This leads to safer and more predictable code.
- Pure functions: A pure function is a function where the return value is only determined by its input values, without observable side effects. This makes the function predictable and easy to test.

Functional programming can be used in Node.js, TypeScript, and Rust. In Node.js and TypeScript, functions are first-class citizens and can be used to create pure functions and to enforce immutability. Rust also supports functional programming with features like first-class and higher-order functions, although it is not a purely functional language [Source 6](https://svitla.com/blog/functional-programming-in-typescript), [Source 10](https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-03_is-rust-fp/).

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

OOP is a paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, and the methods that operate on these objects. It emphasizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Key features of OOP include:
- Encapsulation: It is the bundling of data, and the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit called an object. This makes it easier to manage complexity by breaking down the program into smaller, self-contained objects.
- Inheritance: It is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. This promotes code reusability and can lead to more efficient code.
- Polymorphism: It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This provides a way to use a class that is a placeholder for any subclass of it.

OOP can be used in Node.js, TypeScript, and Rust. In Node.js and TypeScript, you can define classes and create objects from these classes. Rust also supports OOP, although it uses a different approach with structs and implementation blocks instead of classes [Source 8](https://blog.devgenius.io/object-oriented-vs-functional-programming-with-typescript-6b2243bb8c4b), [Source 13](https://blog.logrocket.com/switching-from-rust-to-typescript-and-vice-versa/).

**Comparison**

Functional programming and OOP each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them often depends on the problem you're trying to solve.

Functional programming can lead to safer and more predictable code, and is generally easier to test because of its emphasis on pure functions and immutability. However, it can be harder to understand and use effectively, especially for developers who are used to imperative programming paradigms.

OOP, on the other hand, is often more intuitive to understand and use, especially for modeling real-world scenarios. It can make it easier to manage complexity by breaking down the program into smaller, self-contained objects. However, OOP can lead to more complex and less predictable code, especially when inheritance is used improperly [Source 14](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/benefits-advantages-of-oop/), [Source 24](https://www.calltutors.com/blog/functional-programming-vs-oop/).

In conclusion, both functional programming and OOP have their place in Node.js, TypeScript, and Rust. The key is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each paradigm and to choose the right tool for the job.
