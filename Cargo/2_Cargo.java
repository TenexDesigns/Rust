Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager. It handles tasks such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries. The libraries that your code needs are referred to as dependencies [Source 0](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html).

Cargo comes with several key features and capabilities:

- **Package Management**: Cargo manages Rust projects and their dependencies. It keeps track of the exact versions of dependencies in your project. You can specify the dependencies in the `Cargo.toml` file in the TOML (Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language) format [Source 0](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html).

- **Build System**: Cargo handles the building of your code. It can compile your code, check for errors, and run the executable all in one command. It also provides a command called `cargo check` which quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesn’t produce an executable [Source 0](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html).

- **Project Initialization**: Cargo can create a new project using the `cargo new` command. It generates a `Cargo.toml` file and a `src` directory with a `main.rs` file inside [Source 0](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html).

- **Project Structure**: Cargo expects your source files to live inside the `src` directory. The top-level project directory is just for README files, license information, configuration files, and anything else not related to your code [Source 0](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html).

- **Release Building**: When your project is ready for release, you can use `cargo build --release` to compile it with optimizations. This command will create an executable in `target/release` instead of `target/debug` [Source 0](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html).

Comparing Cargo with npm, both are package managers and build systems for their respective languages. Here are some similarities and differences:

- **Similarities**: Both Cargo and npm handle package dependencies, build projects, and manage project structures. They both provide commands for building, testing, and running projects.

- **Differences**: The main difference lies in the languages they are designed for. Cargo is designed for Rust, while npm is designed for JavaScript and its ecosystem. This means that Cargo has features and capabilities specific to Rust, such as handling Rust's unique package system (crates), while npm has features and capabilities specific to JavaScript, such as handling JavaScript's unique package system (npm packages).

In conclusion, Cargo is a powerful tool for managing Rust projects, handling dependencies, and building your code. It provides a standardized workflow for Rust projects, making it easier for developers to create, manage, and distribute their Rust code.
