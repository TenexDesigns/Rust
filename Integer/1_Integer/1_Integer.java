In Rust, integer data types can be categorized into signed and unsigned integers, each with different sizes. Here are the main integer data types:

### Signed Integers:

1. **`i8`:**
   - 8-bit signed integer.
   - Range: -128 to 127.
   ```rust
   let a: i8 = 42;
   ```

2. **`i16`:**
   - 16-bit signed integer.
   - Range: -32,768 to 32,767.
   ```rust
   let b: i16 = 1234;
   ```

3. **`i32`:**
   - 32-bit signed integer.
   - Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
   ```rust
   let c: i32 = -56789;
   ```

4. **`i64`:**
   - 64-bit signed integer.
   - Range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
   ```rust
   let d: i64 = 9876543210;
   ```

5. **`i128`:**
   - 128-bit signed integer.
   - Range: -170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,728 to 170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,727.
   ```rust
   let e: i128 = -123456789012345678901234567890;
   ```

### Unsigned Integers:

1. **`u8`:**
   - 8-bit unsigned integer.
   - Range: 0 to 255.
   ```rust
   let f: u8 = 255;
   ```

2. **`u16`:**
   - 16-bit unsigned integer.
   - Range: 0 to 65,535.
   ```rust
   let g: u16 = 56789;
   ```

3. **`u32`:**
   - 32-bit unsigned integer.
   - Range: 0 to 4,294,967,295.
   ```rust
   let h: u32 = 1234567890;
   ```

4. **`u64`:**
   - 64-bit unsigned integer.
   - Range: 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.
   ```rust
   let i: u64 = 9876543210987654321;
   ```

5. **`u128`:**
   - 128-bit unsigned integer.
   - Range: 0 to 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,455.
   ```rust
   let j: u128 = 123456789012345678901234567890;
   ```

These integer types allow you to represent both positive and negative integers of various sizes, depending on your specific needs.











------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  Integers are a fundamental data type in Rust, representing whole numbers, both positive and negative. Rust supports various integer types, each with different size and range.

**Signed Integers (i8, i16, i32, i64, isize)**

Signed integers can store both positive and negative values. They are denoted by the prefix 'i' followed by a number indicating the size in bits. The larger the size, the wider the range of values that can be represented.

* **i8:** 8-bit signed integer, can store values from -128 to 127

* **i16:** 16-bit signed integer, can store values from -32768 to 32767

* **i32:** 32-bit signed integer, can store values from -2147483648 to 2147483647

* **i64:** 64-bit signed integer, can store values from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807

* **isize:** Pointer-sized signed integer, can store values from -2^63 to 2^63-1

**Unsigned Integers (u8, u16, u32, u64, usize)**

Unsigned integers can only store positive values (including zero). They are denoted by the prefix 'u' followed by a number indicating the size in bits. Similar to signed integers, the larger the size, the wider the range of values that can be represented.

* **u8:** 8-bit unsigned integer, can store values from 0 to 255

* **u16:** 16-bit unsigned integer, can store values from 0 to 65535

* **u32:** 32-bit unsigned integer, can store values from 0 to 4294967295

* **u64:** 64-bit unsigned integer, can store values from 0 to 18446744073709551615

* **usize:** Pointer-sized unsigned integer, can store values from 0 to 2^64-1

**Choosing the Right Integer Type**

The choice of integer type depends on the specific requirements of the program. For instance, if you're dealing with ages or small counts, an i8 or u8 might suffice. However, if you're handling large numbers, such as financial transactions or scientific calculations, i64 or u64 would be more appropriate.
